# pandas-challenge

I have created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to analyse school and standardised test data to help the school board and mayor of my LGA make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. I was given access to every student's maths and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend.

I have firstly created a DataFrame that combines both school data and student data.
Then I created a high-level snapshot of the local government area's key metrics and stored them in a DataFrame.
Next I created a DataFrame that summarises key metrics about each school.
Then I displayed the Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) and the Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing).
Next I created DataFrames that list the average maths score and average reading score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.
Finally I created tables that break down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student), school size and school type.

Based on the analysis, the average per student budget spent on the Lowest Performing Schools ($636) is higher than that spent on the Highest Performing Schools ($611).
The Independently operated schools have slightly better average maths and reading scores than Government operated schools. The Independently operated schools also have better passing rates for maths, reading and overall than Government operated schools.
